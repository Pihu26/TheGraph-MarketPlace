# The Graph Indexing and Subgraph Queries

This project demonstrates the use of **The Graph** for indexing blockchain data and querying it through subgraphs. It includes a comprehensive guide on setting up a subgraph and executing GraphQL queries to retrieve data efficiently.

## Project Overview

### Description
The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains. This project focuses on creating a subgraph to index specific smart contract events and enable efficient querying through GraphQL.

### Key Features
- **Subgraph Creation**: A step-by-step guide to creating a subgraph for a specific smart contract.
- **Indexing Events**: Efficiently indexing on-chain data such as transfers, minting events, or any relevant contract interactions.
- **GraphQL Queries**: Example queries to retrieve indexed data in a structured format.
